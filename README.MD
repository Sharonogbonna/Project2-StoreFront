# Sharomatherapy

## Technologies Used

* **React.js** for front-end development.
* **Node.js** as runtime environment of JS.
* **Mongoose** as library for MongoDB.
* **MongoDB** as a database for storing items in a collection.
* **Express.js** as a framework.
* **Vanilla CSS** for styling

## Credits
As I mentioned earlier, this was my first project ever so I am super thankful for the guidance and help I received along the way. Special shout out my instructors, Kasper and Tishana, as well as my friend Jag. 


 I realized I never got to tell y'all what the show in your video. In your less than 5min video, you need to:
Tell us about your store,
 Show each restful route (INDUCES),
Show your routes in your code
Talk about your biggest challenge.

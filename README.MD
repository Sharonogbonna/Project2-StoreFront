# Sharomatherapy
Sharomatherapy is a model store front that sells items for aromatherapy. It was created using the JavaScript, the MERN stack, and CSS. It allows for users to add, edit, delete, and "buy" items.

The user also has the option to shop by category. When selected it will only display the items that fall into that category.

When the user selects an item, it will bring them to that items page. Here, the user has the option to buy the item, delete the item from the database, or edit the items information.

## Technologies Used

* **React.js** for front-end development.
* **Node.js** as runtime environment of JS.
* **Mongoose** as library for MongoDB.
* **MongoDB** as a database for storing items in a collection.
* **Express.js** as a framework.
* **Vanilla CSS** for styling

## How to Access

**Install necessary dependencies:**
* `npm init -y`
* `npm i`
* `npm i -g nodemon`

**Create .nvm file:**
* Create a .env file and link it to a MongoDB database

**Start app:**
* Run nodemon in the terminal and open the app using [Local Host 3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Credits
As I mentioned earlier, this was my first project ever so I am super thankful for the guidance and help I received along the way. Special shout out my instructors, Kasper and Tishana, as well as my friend Jag. 


 I realized I never got to tell y'all what the show in your video. In your less than 5min video, you need to:
Tell us about your store,
 Show each restful route (INDUCES),
Show your routes in your code
Talk about your biggest challenge.

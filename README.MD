# Sharomatherapy
Sharomatherapy is a model store front that sells items for aromatherapy. It was created using the JavaScript, the MERN stack, and CSS. It allows for users to add, edit, delete, and "buy" items.

The user also has the option to shop by category. When selected it will only display the items that fall into that category.

## Technologies Used

* **React.js** for front-end development.
* **Node.js** as runtime environment of JS.

## Additional thoughts

I really enjoyed working on this project. I realized that I enjoy full stack development, but I *really* enjoy front-end work. I like working with the css and assisting other classmates with it. I am hoping to get more experience using animations and transitions to make pages more interactive.
